# Healthy-warming-soups

Insipiration for the layout I've got from walkthrough for wiskey webpage.
Since I was struggling to find specific tamplate for dropdown button in bootstrap, notes from html essentials and book about html, so found what I wanted in youtube tutorial.

All images were found in Google.

Majority of information in "About" section is taken from Wikipedia.

I was using additional "help" to make my code work properly from youtube tutorials and w3schools webage. 

All recipes used is from my memory of how we make them at home and at the moment these are my favouretes.

Validation done in https://validator.w3.org/, where all pages passed 100%.

For all information I used google search and youtube, of which I used few links in here.
