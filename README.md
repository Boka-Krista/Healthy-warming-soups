# [HEALTHY WARMING SOUPS](https://boka-krista.github.io/Healthy-warming-soups)


My original plan was to create a website dedicated to some soup recipes so it becomes like online version of a cookbook with various soups which are very popular around the Europe. All of used recipes I've known since my early childhood, so finding images and using the actual recipes were used form my memory. 

Main goal for creating this type of website is that nowadays people tend to find new interesting or even fancy food ideas online, so in this page it all would be together as an healthier choice for dinner, and tried to make sure that it is made in a way so it is easy to follow and the additional information is in different page whcih would not overwhelm people by scrolling too much and trying to find the start of the recipe (which I know could be annoying sometimes). 

Then I decided to add some "history" and general information about them - where the soups are coming from and to make things more interesting used youtube links for different verions of the same product.
Most of the information I've found on wikipedia and some online magazines, which seemed relevant so much so that I used one of the links on my main page for people to have a look at it as weel (few facts of why they are benefitial in your diet).


## UX



Original web design idea I got from one of the walk through lessons which was about wiskeys. When started working on it, couple times I accidentally deleted part of the code, so had to start over. Then I slowly "moved" away from that idea and started to make my own little changes such as removing quotes and changing the image position and instead of that added some generalised information about the soups so the home page would not look too empty. 

in about page I decided to put some history behind each of the soups so people woudn't habe to do additional search in case they were interested where these recipes originally come from. 

Each soup recipes been used from my memory and additional google search to make sure I don't forget anything about it.

Then there was an idea of adding signing up page so in theory people could sign up so follow for more relevant content - new soup recipes without struggles to find the right website.



### Colour Scheme



Homepage: rgb(218, 233, 119) used for background and rgb(108, 40, 171) for text.
About page: lavander for background colour and blueviolet for text.
Borsch: darksalmon colour for background and navy colour for text.
Split peas soup: goldenrod for background colour and rgb(59, 83, 83) for text.
Souerkraut soup: khaki as background colour and green for text.
Sign up page: aqua for background and default (black) for text.
Thank you page: chartreuse for background colour and blueviolet for text.



### Typography



All the fonts I chose I've got inspiration from w3schools website, where before choosing I could test it on how it would look like.
Here is the used link: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_font-family .

For home page I have used font Courier New.
About page is done using monospace.
Borsch page is done with Georgia.
Split peas soup page is in Verdana.
Souerkraut soup is also done in Verdana.
Thank you notification is done in Segoe UI.

# Testing




Throughout my project I kept testing my code in https://validator.w3.org and tried to fix any possible errors right away. At the same time while working on it, at all times I had preview (python3 -m http.server) opened to see if all navbar buttons are responsive and if added links are working as supposed to like opening in new tab etc.


## Code Validation

At first I validated each page separately, which all passed and is seen in documentation folder.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.
