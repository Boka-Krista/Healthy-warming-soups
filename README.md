# Healthy-warming-soups

Insipiration for the layout I've got from walkthrough for wiskey webpage.
Since I was struggling to find specific tamplate for dropdown button in bootstrap, notes from html essentials and book about html, so found what I wanted in youtube tutorial.

All images were found in Google.

Majority of information in "About" section is taken from Wikipedia.

I was using additional "help" to make my code work properly from youtube tutorials and w3schools webage. 

All recipes used is from my memory of how we make them at home and at the moment these are my favouretes.

Validation done in https://validator.w3.org/ while everything has passed, just shown error for main images about values, when tried to fix it by their standarts in order to pass everything, the images didn't look as good - either too small or too stretched, so switched back to height and width to 100%
