   <h1>Additional information</h1>

   <p>Most of current recipes require smoked meat, but you can substitute them with regular meat, but please make sure you cook it 30-90 minutes longer, so it becomes much softer.</p>

   <h2>Little bit of history of our soups</h2>
   <h3>Beetroot/borsch soup</h3>
   <br>
   <p>Soups are commonly made with vegetables and broth or kefir.
    Borscht is quintessentially Russian. A single bowl of that ruby-red beetroot soup, served with a ladleful of smetana (sour cream) and a hunk of black bread, conjures up images of Red Square and St Basil’s Cathedral almost as much as a glass of vodka or a spoonful of caviar.

Except that borscht is not Russian at all. Nor was it originally made with beetroot.

Exactly when and where borscht appeared is something of a mystery; but it was probably first made in what is now Ukraine, somewhere between the fifth and ninth centuries AD. Back then, it was a simple broth cooked from cow-parsnips, a plant commonly found in hedgerows and fields; and it was from the Proto-Slavic word for cow-parsnips that it took its name.
   
Associated cuisine for this soup Ukrainian, Armenian, Ashkenazi Jewish, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Chinese, Czech, Estonian, Georgian, Iranian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Mennonite, Moldovan, Polish, Romanian, Russian.</p>

<h3>Split peas</h3>

<p>Pea soup or split pea soup is soup made typically from dried peas, such as the split pea. It is, with variations, a part of the cuisine of many cultures. It is most often greyish-green or yellow in color depending on the regional variety of peas used; all are cultivars of Pisum sativu
    Pea soup is a common dish throughout Germany. It often contains meat such as bacon, sausage or Kassler (cured and smoked pork) depending on regional preferences. Very often, several sausages will accompany a serving of pea soup as well as some dark bread. Ready-made soup in cans is sometimes used to prepare the dish.

One of the first instant products was a pea soup product, which mainly consisted of pea meal and beef fat (Erbswurst [de]: pea sausage). It was invented in 1867 by Johann Heinrich Grüneberg, who sold the recipe to the Prussian state. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, the war ministry, which had previously tested the possibility of feeding soldiers solely on instant pea soup and bread, built a large manufacturing plant and produced between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of Erbswurst for the army during the war. In 1889, the Knorr instant-food company bought the license. Knorr, which is today a Unilever brand, discontinued the production of Erbswurst on December 31, 2018
In Poland, pea soup is typically associated with the military, where it still remains a popular dish. This is because pea soup is nutritious and cheap, and can be easily prepared in large quantities. Military pea soup (grochówka wojskowa) is said to have to be thick enough to put a spoon straight up in it. Though the pea soup is normally prepared in messes, the dish is typically associated with field kitchens. Currently, decommissioned field kitchens are often used during mass events.

<h3>Sourekraut soup</h3>
<p>In most of Latvia sauerkraut soup (Latvian: skābu kāpostu zupa) is made with sauerkraut, potatoes, carrots and groats, but the region in Latgale only sauerkraut and bacon is used.
    In fact, some similar varieties of this soup is also found around Germany, Poland and Russia.
